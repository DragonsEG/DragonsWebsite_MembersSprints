## RSVPs for the event of the speaker go both ways :

1.  zoho webinar? for automation, email reminding for the users,(cons: 1h only webinar)
2. form that stores the results into a DB (WARNING: SQL injection)

## FAQ section (frequently asked questions )
- Who is the webinar for? 
- What are the benefits of attending the webinar? know more people and get exposed to the topic from an expert perspective 
- How can I register for the webinar? simple steps  
- Is it FREE? yes ...
- Will there be a Q&A session? 100% of every webinar that we have Q&A will be part of it 
(put 3-4 more)




## Sponsors Area (for the season) 
- you can design the card for them and the functionality first (then we will put the logos of them)

## Testimonials 
-  section for feedback (video comments)
- the ability to show the comment throw a link 
- if the link is broken, Put a fallback for it 

# Contact info: dragons@divzoon.com

# created by Dragons Member (Know More) => in the future for the footer section redesign

# Challenge 

## Show the time right for the user according to his timezone
-  we can use an API for that (Most accurate) EX: WorldTimeAPI (cons: not always available)
- we can use the web capability to get the location of the user and then the time 
- we can access the Date(); (cons: with Egypt, the time is 1h early )
